# HGPR_SST_Proxy_Calibration v.1

This software is designed for learning calibration models for sea surface temperature proxies based on the heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression. Descriptions are found in [Lee and Lawrence, Heteroscedastic Gaussian Process Regression on the Alkenone over Sea Surface Temperatures (2019)] now available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08843.
